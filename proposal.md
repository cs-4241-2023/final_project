# Proposal
**Group:** Adelynn Martin, David Rosenstein, Colin Mettler

Our team decided to program a chat room application for WPI students called GoatChats. The technologies and libraries we plan on using are: Node.js, `express`, `cookie-session`, `web-sockets`, `squirrelly`, and `postgresql`. We chose postgres for our database because we all have had more experience with SQL so we think it will be easier to use than MongoDB. Our key features we plan to implement are multiple live chatrooms that live update, user accounts with encryption on the passwords and sessions, some sort of authentication (ideally we would like to be able to use their WPI accounts but we are unsure if that is possible), and different levels of account hierarchy like users and admins with different privileges.

This chatroom will be overlayed on a map of WPI. This map will be interactive, with specific chatrooms being defined for each residential building on campus. A user, upon being logged in, will be able to select a residential building using the map at which point they are entered into the chatroom for that building, allowing them to chat with their friends, find new friends within the same or other residential buildings, plan social events, and more. In addition there are admins for this app who could be residential advisors and other trusted users. They have additional privileges which include deleting messages and banning users, to keep the chatroom safe.
