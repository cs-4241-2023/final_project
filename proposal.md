Clicker game that starts with apples. As the game goes on you are allowed to “grow” more fruits that will sell for more.
You will also be able to upgrade your tools and selling capacity to make more in-game currency. There will be plenty of
user input features that could be clicked on such as upgrades along with a continuous goal of selling more apples. To obtain
apples you will need to click a button repeatedly and as time goes on you will be able to “purchase” equipment that will help
you obtain apples easier.

We plan on using Javascript as the main language to handle the functionality of the game while HTML and CSS will be used for
front-end development of appearance. To write our code we will be using Visual Studio and Glitch while using an Express server
if needed.
