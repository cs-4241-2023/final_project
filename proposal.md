# What’s the Deal
*A project proposal by: Ethan Catania, Nandita Kumar, Tucker Raymond*


	What’s the Deal will be an application that is built for food lovers and restaurant owners alike, with its core audience being people who are
     looking to save money but are not always aware of local deals and discounts. It will provide a platform for restaurants to showcase their specials and deals to people who are on the lookout for them. This application will be especially useful for local businesses who may not have a large platform by which to draw in customers, as well as college students or people who are fiscally frugal.

	The main page of the application will contain a list of deals from local restaurants which can be sorted based on price point, and style of
     food. There will also be a page where the user can view deals for upcoming days. Each deal will also have a type such as recurring or one-time, as well as a start and end date for the deal if applicable. The application will be such that users will have to log into an account, and only verified accounts will be able to add deals to the database. We are also planning on creating a way to leave user reviews on deals so that other users can view them. The main technologies that we will be implementing in this project are the React framework, JavaScript, MongoDB for persistent storage, NodeJS, and Express.
