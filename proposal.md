## Proposal
---
For our project we would like to build a character customization application, that will allow a user to build characters using a combination of sprites layered on top of each other. \
The user will need to login to our application/create an account to begin. 
Then the user will be able to choose a sprite (8 bit models/Animals) and choose accessories and apparel from a table/different tabs depending on the type of clothing. 
After the user is done selecting apparel they will have the ability to give their character a backstory and generate an export to share with their friends. 
Additionally the characters will be able to be saved and loaded by the user after they are done creating them.
To create this project we will use React, MongoDB, Express. We will also be hosting our application on Heroku because of its git integration. 
We plan on using a CSS framework, but will wait till we have a working application to choose one to use. We also may use cookie-session to store login information.
