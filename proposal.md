## Description
We are creating an idle clicker game called Cat Clicker. Our idle clicker will dynamically respond to user input with sprite animations and a score that is stored in an online server. The score increased via a rate that can be bought with score points.

We will use Javascript and Node, as well as MongoDB. We will also use Phaser which is a mobile and desktop html game framework. The player will login to the webpage, which will allow them to play the game and save their score. Once logged in, they start playing right where they left off by loading their associated game data from the database.
