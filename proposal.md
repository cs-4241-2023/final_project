Final Project - Bitcoin Clicker (Bitcoin subject to change)

Keaton Mangone, Nathaniel Sadlier

We plan on implementing a clicker game that is centered around bitcoin (subject to change), in which the user clicks a bitcoin photo to receive BTC, a sense of currency in the game for progression. At the basic level, there will be autoclickers & upgrades available for the user to purchase with mined BTC. However, as time permits, we would like to add more game progression mechanics to make the game more interesting. There will also be a save status of some sort (whether through login information or a simple save button). If we go the save button route we plan on returning an ID that when inputted into a load button will retrieve your save state on another platform. Otherwise, we will have simple login functionality to maintain user data that way.

Technology to be used: React, CSS, MongoDB, Vite
