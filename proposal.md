## Proposal
~~Fruit Ninja~~ Vegetable Samurai


Vegetable Samurai (name TBD) is an online web game shockingly similar to Fruit Ninja™, but different! Clearly. The game will have a login screen, where users are given the option to create an account, login, or play as guest. If logged in, users can play the game (slash vegetables, avoid bombs), buy new blades from the store, or view quests (optional feature depending on time). Slashing starvegetables while ingame gives the user in-game currency to buy fancy blades to use in game. Blades may have special features to improve gameplay, or just be cosmetic. Quests also give currency. Guest users’ progress (currency, purchased blades, and quests) will not be saved, logged in users can store high scores and their progress. Optional 2-player split screen mode will be added depending on development time. 

## Main Functions: 
1. Store for blades 
2. Randomly generated vegetable rendering 
3. Database stores high score, purchased blades, currency earned 
4. Shop 
5. Blade rendering 
6. Login / pay as guest 
7. Bombs 
8. Starfruitsvegetables 

## Optional Features (Time Dependant): 
1. Split screen 2 player session 
2. Quests
