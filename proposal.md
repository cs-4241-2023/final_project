Group Members: Andrew Hariyanto, Bright Lin, Nathan Wong, & Nelson Diaz

## General description
Multiplayer game website similar to Club Penguin. We will create a three areas:
1. **Lobby** - This is where players will spawn when they first enter the website. They can walk around and possibly send messages.
2. **Customization Shop** - Here, players can make small customization changes to their avatar such as choosing a pet. These changes will persist between sessions.
3. **Card House** - Here, players will be able to challenge each other to a card game with simple mechanics. Winning will give the player a little bit of money that they can spend at the customization shop.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js Runtime
- Express Server
- MongoDB for persistence
- Socket.IO for multiplayer communication
