# A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)
Cat Clicker is an idle clicker that dynamically responds to user input with sprite animations and a score that is stored in an online server. The score increased via a rate that can be bought with score points. The player can login to the webpage, which allows them to play the game and save their score. Once logged in, they can start playing right where they left off by loading their associated game data from the database.

#. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information etc.)
Our default login is admin/admin, but you can create any account you want. We also noticed that the speed of the game varies depends a lot depending on the hardware of the machine, so try to test it on a fast machine if you can. 

# An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
We used Javascript and Node, as well as MongoDB to access and interact with a online server to store our player’s data. We also used Phaser which is a mobile and desktop html game framework. 

# What challenges you faced in completing the project.
Learning how to use Phaser.js in our program was difficult as none of us had used it before. We’re also all seniors working on our MQPs, so it was hard to find time to schedule meetings and work on the project. 

# What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
Tate - Login functionality, hooked up the mongodb database, and developed backend
Ryan - Graphics + sprite animations, backend hookups to buttons 
Alex - Game implementation in phaser, gameplay, controls
