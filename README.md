Our project is a community calendar meant for college students. Students must sign in to access the calendar, and once signed in they can input their own events, and can then edit only their events. After signing in, students see a calendar and in the top there is a button to add events. After hitting the button, the student will be taken to a form that asks for the time, group it's for, who it's open to, and location of event (front-end server). After their events are added, students can also see their events below the calendar and modify or delete accordingly. 

We'll be using React and express.js to code the front-end and back-end of the server. We'll be using MongoDB to store the data in the backend. We'll be implementing a CSS framework (we'll select it after we've coded more of the front-end to decide which is the best fit) and we'll implement the design best practices and accessibility from the readings.
