# I-MAMA (Create and Share application)
We created a character customization applicaiton, where a user can log in to their account, create and store characters, and export them.
We decided to host this project on heroku. You can access the project here: https://custom-app-0e9201007f26.herokuapp.com

When viewing characeters in the dashboard, characters will only appear after hovering, and make sure to click the save button to save your character after creating it.

One significant challenge that we faced was it was difficult for us to figure out how to render each piece of the character individually. We didn't want the pieces to overlap each other and we wanted the character to not render until each piece was fetched from the database and loaded successfully. 

The technologies we used for this project were: React (with TypeScript), Vite, Express, Passport, bcryptjs, MUI (Material-UI), MongoDB, dotenv, and html2canvas.

Our responsibilites:

- Isabella Pabon - created the build page, saving, debugging.

- Mirandi McCormick - responsible for all character art and images for character creation

- Michael - Created the character builder UI and assisted with debugging

- Amanda Blanchard - dashboard page, export, delete

- Arnav - authentication service including passport for server, added header for simple control in web app
