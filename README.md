# Morning Dashboard

Our Morning Dashboard application displays the most important information you'll need after waking up. We took inspiration from Windows XP when choosing the background and including Clippy! Once the app opens, Clippy slides into the main view and gives the user a fun CS fact!

The header includes a greeting, current date, time, and weather (weather and user greeting is customizable in settings). Our app also provides a schedule manager in our home page, which takes an event title and time to display what the user has to look forward to later on. Our application also features customizable sidebar buttons, which can be changed in the settings tab, and a dynamic background that gets darker after 6PM.
